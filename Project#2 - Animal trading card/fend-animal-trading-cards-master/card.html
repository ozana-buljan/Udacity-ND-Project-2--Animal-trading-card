    <p class="description">As a top-level carnivore, the big cat helps prevent overgrazing of vegetation by keeping its prey populations in balance. Jaguars are also important in human culture, frequently playing a central role in stories, songs and prayers of indigenous people.
      Yet today, jaguars have been almost completely eliminated from the United States.</p>
